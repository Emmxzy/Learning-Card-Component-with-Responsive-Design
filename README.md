# Frontend Mentor - Learning Card Component Solution  

This is a solution to the [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.  

## Overview  

### The challenge  

Users should be able to:  

- View a clean and responsive learning card component with clear hierarchy and design.
- Understand the layout's structure and content details at a glance.  

## My process  

### Built with  

- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- CSS custom properties  
- Flexbox  
- Mobile-first workflow  

### What I learned  

Working on this project helped solidify my understanding of CSS properties, including `box-shadow`, `border-radius`, and `flexbox` for layout alignment. Below is an example of the CSS code I used for the card footer:  

```css  
.card-footer {  
  display: flex;  
  align-items: center;  
  margin-top: 15px;  
}  
```  

Additionally, I learned to ensure proper spacing and hierarchy within a card component for a professional, clean look.  

### Continued development  

I aim to deepen my skills in CSS Grid and explore animation techniques to enhance visual engagement in future projects.  

### Useful resources  

- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me understand how to center content and align items effectively.  
- [MDN Web Docs - Box Shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - A great reference for creating depth with shadows.
